# Optimized SharePoint Data Retrieval for Power BI

## Overview

**Supercharge your Power BI dashboards** by integrating SharePoint data the smart way.

This project delivers an **efficient and reliable method** for retrieving data from SharePoint lists using the **SharePoint REST API**, replacing the default connector. The result? **Faster refreshes**, **persistent connections**, and **zero timeout issues**—even when paired with complex, on-prem SQL Server sources.

---

## The Challenge

Power BI's native SharePoint connector wasn’t cutting it. Here’s what was going wrong:

- **Timeout Errors**: SharePoint connections expired after 1 hour during long refreshes.
- **Failed Updates**: Combined refreshes with on-prem SQL took too long, leading to broken pipelines.
- **Data Loss Risk**: Mid-refresh timeouts caused incomplete or missing reports.

---

## The Solution

By switching to the **SharePoint REST API with pagination**, we solved all of that:

- **Streamlined Refreshes**: REST API handles large datasets with seamless pagination.
- **Persistent Connections**: The API stays active, even when the SQL Server takes its time.
- **Performance Boost**: Refresh times are dramatically reduced in Power BI Service.
